# TranslationAPIOptimization
Example of Optimizing calls to the Google Translation API on iOS

## Setup
This app makes calls to the Google Cloud Translation API for translations. You can see in Search.swift it uses a struct called Secrets to hold a key that isn't in this repo. 
You can find out how to get your own API key [here](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/) with google's documentation.
